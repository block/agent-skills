# rp-why: Gas Town × DOK Framework

A self-reflection skill for AI agents that measures and improves AI collaboration practice.

## Quick Start

1. Run `/rp-why init` to establish your baseline
2. Run `/rp-why current` at the end of sessions to see your DOK distribution
3. Run `/rp-why compare` to track progress against your baseline

## What It Measures

- **Gas Town Stage**: How sophisticated are your AI tools? (1-8 scale)
- **DOK Level**: How cognitively complex are your prompts? (1-4 scale)
- **Quadrant Position**: Where do you fall on the integration matrix?

## Why Use This?

Without measurement, there's no improvement. This skill helps you:

- See patterns in your AI collaboration
- Identify when you're underutilizing powerful tools
- Get actionable nudges to level up your prompts
- Track growth over time
