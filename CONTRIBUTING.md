# Contributing to Agent Skills

Thank you for your interest in contributing an Agent Skill! 🎉

This repository is a community-driven collection of reusable skills that help AI agents (like Goose, Claude Desktop, and others) perform real-world tasks more effectively.

This guide explains:

* What makes a good skill
* How to structure your files
* How to validate your submission
* How to submit a pull request successfully

---

## What is an Agent Skill?

An Agent Skill is a reusable set of instructions (and optional supporting files) that teaches an AI agent how to perform a specific workflow or task.

Good examples include:

* Deployment checklists
* Code review workflows
* Incident response procedures
* API integration guides
* Internal tooling workflows
* Templates paired with instructions

Skills should be:

* **Focused** (one workflow or domain per skill)
* **Clear** (written for both humans and agents)
* **Reusable** (not tied to one person’s machine or secrets)

---

## Repository Structure

Each skill lives in its own folder at the root of the repository:

```
api-setup/
  SKILL.md
code-review/
  SKILL.md
  checklist.md
production-deploy/
  SKILL.md
  deploy.sh
  templates/
    config.template.json
```

Every skill **must** include a `SKILL.md` file.

---

## SKILL.md Format

Each `SKILL.md` must contain:

1. YAML frontmatter
2. The skill content written in Markdown

### Required Frontmatter

Your file must start with YAML frontmatter containing at least:

```md
---
name: api-setup
description: Helps set up a new API integration with standard configuration
---
```

Guidelines:

* `name` should match the folder name
* Use lowercase with hyphens (`api-setup`, `code-review`)
* `description` should be clear and concise (1 sentence)

---

## Writing Good Skills

Skills are instructions for agents. Write them to be:

* **Explicit** (don’t assume hidden knowledge)
* **Structured** (use headings, numbered steps, checklists)
* **Verifiable** (include validation or success criteria)

### Recommended structure

```md
---
name: production-deploy
description: Safe deployment workflow for production releases
---

# Production Deployment

## Purpose
This skill guides an agent through a safe production deployment.

## Preconditions
- All tests passing
- Required approvals obtained

## Steps
1. Create release branch from main
2. Run `npm run build:prod`
3. Deploy to staging and verify
4. Deploy to production

## Verification
- [ ] Service responds with 200
- [ ] Error rate below 1%

## Rollback
If issues occur:
1. Revert deployment
2. Notify #incidents
3. Open incident report
```

---

## Supporting Files

Skills may include supporting files such as:

* Scripts (`.sh`, `.js`, `.py`)
* Templates
* Example configs
* Checklists

These should live inside the skill folder:

```
api-setup/
  SKILL.md
  setup.sh
  templates/
    config.template.json
```

Avoid including:

* Secrets or API keys
* Personal paths
* Machine-specific assumptions

---

## Validation

All submissions are automatically validated by CI.

Validation checks include:

* Required `SKILL.md` present
* Valid YAML frontmatter
* Folder and name consistency
* Safe file structure

If validation fails, you’ll see feedback directly on your pull request.

You can fix the issues and push updates — the PR will revalidate automatically.

## How to Submit a Skill

1. **Fork this repository**
2. Create a new branch
3. Add your skill folder
4. Commit your changes
5. Open a pull request using the Submit a Skill template

## What Maintainers Look For

We prioritize skills that are:

* Useful to a broad audience
* Clearly written and structured
* Safe (no secrets, no destructive defaults)
* Focused on one workflow or domain

We may suggest revisions — that’s normal and part of the collaboration process.

## Need Help?

If you’re unsure whether your idea is a good fit:

* Open a draft pull request
* Ask questions in the PR description
* Start a discussion (if enabled)

We’re happy to help you shape your contribution.
